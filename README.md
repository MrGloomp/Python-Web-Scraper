# Python-Web-Scraper
An early project where I used Python to scrape reviews from Rotten Tomatoes as raw data and store them for processing. The script stored the reviewer's name, the rating for the movie, the date and the review text itself. Although the results are printed onto the screen, a more applicable use for this would be to sore them in a .csv/ .xlsx file.
